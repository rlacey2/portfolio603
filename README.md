## 510 Modelling In JSON  - Data Structure vs Presentation
#### February 2018  

Cloud demos (if deployed) at:

A teaching example of modelling data with two different structures and its presentation via nested ng-repeats.

An issue for the designer/programmer would occur when using one of the models and requiring both presentations.

Each version facilitates one of the presentations easily, however, more coding work is required to represent as the alternate version.


Essentially think about the model and the presentation consequences.
